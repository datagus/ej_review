**About the files**


Pipeline.ipynb is the notebook that I used to create the screening table from the search string

coloring_string.ipynb is just a notebook where I was experimenting coloring the strings in excel

google_test.ipynb is another notebook where I was experimenting with google sheets API and formatting the table from python

screening_inspection.ipynb is the notebook for importing the screening abstracts table and setting up for the downloading process.

The json files, if you need them, I will put them in the google drive for the environmenta justice review. If it is optional, you can do it manually without json files. I did this way not to expose my data in the github repository. 

**Usage**

Please download the files and run everyhing locally, no jupyter server, nor google colab


Cheers!
